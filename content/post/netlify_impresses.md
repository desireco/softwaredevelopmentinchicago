So, this site lay fallow for a little bit, like a year or so :). Maybe less. I was really busy.


So now I had some time and read through few articles about how people deploy their sites. I knew about [Netlify](http://netlify.com) from before, but made me look again and it is really super awesome and simple to have site with them. Static sites are their thing and it is a joy to see, just update site, commit to git and things happen in the background and boom! Updates are live.
