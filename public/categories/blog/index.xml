      <description>My adventure with devEngine started really well, but after a while all activity just stupped, which really is sad, as this is great project. I tried several things to review it and but nothing seemed to work.
From this perspective, it is obvious some of the issues I had, but nothing was really huge, for some reason we didn&amp;rsquo;t gain traction.
For now it is stopped but I am working on some way to get it up and running again.</description>

      <description>So, this site lay fallow for a little bit, like a year or so :). Maybe less. I was really busy. Seriously.
So now I had some time and read through few articles about how people deploy their sites. I knew about Netlify from before, but made me look again and it is really super awesome and simple to have site with them. Static sites are their thing and it is a joy to see, just update site, commit to git and things happen in the background and boom!</description>

      <description>This is my new site. I went through a lot of false starts. Tried a lot of different tools to publish my thoughts, you would think I write a lot since I was obesessing so much about how to make it as easy as possible.
Winner In the end, here we are, Hugo is the winner.
It started with Middleman I started originally with Middleman. I got frustrated as theming took too much time and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t super focused to begin with.</description>
